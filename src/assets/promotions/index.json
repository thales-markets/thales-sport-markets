            "contentHtml": "<p>The start of the Overdrop League marks a new era in incentives on Overtime. Everything you do on the platform counts toward your total XP, your XP determines your rewards at the end of the season, and you can reach several levels/milestones to get OVER free bets throughout the year, along with other perks. In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP. The total rewards pool for this season is 100,000 OP and 200,000 ARB.</p> <h2>How does the Overdrop League work?</h2> <p>The Overdrop League lets you earn rewards and boost your earnings on Overtime by accumulating trading volume, maintaining usage streaks, using OVER as collateral, sharing your parlays on socials, building multi-game parlays, and collecting event- or sports-specific points modifiers! You can level up your way to 33,850 OVER and unlock many additional perks and bonuses along the way. Track your progress in the new Overdrop section of your profile in the navigation. The base calculation for your XP is calculated like this: Base XP = Buy-In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). In simpler terms, your wager gets more base XP the higher your buy-in and odds are. <br /><br />Buy-In in this case means the amount of $ that you placed as a Buy-In on the respective wager. Normalized Odds mean the odds of your wager shown in the format of a Normalized Probability between 0 and 1. For example, the Decimal Odds expression of 1.60 is 0.625 in the Normalized Odds format. You can boost your XP gains in the following way: </p> <ul> <li>Daily streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive day wagering on OT, up to 35%</li> <li>Weekly streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive week wagering on OT, up to 20%</li> <li>X Flex boost: An additional 10% XP for 3 days after sharing your parlay on X that can be reactivated after the booster expires</li> <li>Parlay boost: Up to 700% in additional XP based on how many games you add to your parlay</li> <li>OVER boost: 10% additional XP for using OVER as collateral for a specific wager/trade</li> <li>Loyalty boost: Up to 25% in permanent additional XP rewarded based on your level</li> </ul> <p><br />As you level up, you will receive a permanent XP boost for hitting the following levels: </p> <ul> <li>Level 1-5: 5% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 6-10: 10% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 11-15: 15% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 16-20: 20% XP Boost</li> </ul> <p><br />Throughout the season, you'll gradually unlock 33,850 OVER in free bets after hitting certain levels. Keep in mind that the free bets will be airdropped to your wallet on the first Friday after you level up to the required level. The free bets are divided up as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Level 4: 50 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 6: 200 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 8: 600 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 10: 1,500 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 12: 3,000 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 14: 4,500 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 16: 6,000 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 18: 8,000 OVER Free Bet</li> <li>Level 20: 10,000 OVER Free Bet</li> </ul> <p><br />You can check out more details about the levels and rewards <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OvertimeMarkets.xyz/the-overdrop-league-cbff6c4b63b5\"><u>here</u></a>. Or you can just head on straight to the <a href=\"https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/overdrop\"><u>Overdrop page</u></a> and start leveling up. <br /><br />Overdrop was built to give you more free stuff in a gamified way that’s unlike anything you've seen in traditional sportsbooks.

Keep in mind that, as time goes on, we'll find new ways to give you cool rewards and make your life on Overtime more fun</p> <h2>Don't miss out on the other great incentives on Overtime</h2> <p>Overtime regularly organizes kickbacks, dedicated rewards for the biggest sports events and leagues, and sportsbook competitions.You can use the <a href=\"https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/promotions\"><u>promotions page</u></a> to keep an eye out for ongoing and future goodies you can grab, as well as find out how to qualify and how your wallet is doing on various rewards leaderboards.</p>"

The base calculation of how much XP your bet gains, is calculated via the following formula: </span> </span> <ul> <li>Base NFL XP = Buy In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). This means that the higher the buy-in and odds of the bet, the more NFL XP the bet earns.</span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>You can further exponentially boost the amount of NFL XP by building Parlays, and even boost more by doing System Bets.</span> </span> </span></span> </span> </span> </li></li> </ul><br> PARLAY BOOST: Earn as much as 8X boost on your points by betting on NFL parlays instead of singles! Have at least one NFL game on your parlay and depending on how many individual games are within your parlay, you will get an additional multiplier on your bet XP. Every new game added on a parlay adds +0.5x more on your multiplier of NFL XP points. The Parlay Boost formula is: Base NFL XP * ((n+1)/2), where 'n' is the number of games in parlay. <br><br>SYSTEM BETS BOOST: If your Parlay is a System Bet, your final NFL XP for that bet gains another 2X multiplier! <br><br>All eligible bettors will earn their share of:<br><ul> <li>10,000 OP on Optimism and 10,000 ARB on Arbitrum, received as free bets on both networks immediately after the Super Bowl</span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>50,000 worth of OVER token free bets on launch day, coming soon in Q1 of 2025!</span> </span> </span></span> </span> </span> </li></li> </ul><br>Your rewards will depend on your final share of NFL XP points.

Available on Optimism, Arbitrum, and the <a href=\"https://x.com/OvertimeMarkets/status/1896932405304283486\"> just recently added Base </a> , the competition will reward the top 20 brackets by the number of points collected from predicted game outcomes. Each March Madness bracket is minted as an NFT and costs 20 USDC to produce, and the total number of participants will be used to determine the total prize pool. But this is not the only news that awaits you! In addition to the bracket competition, you’ll now be able to bet on March Madness player props and create Same Game Parlays on Overtime! </p> <h2> Bracket Competition Rules and Rewards </h2> <p> If this is your first March Madness bracket competition, let’s break down how this works. To participate, you have to predict the winner of each tournament matchup from start to finish (March 20 - April 7). As mentioned, your prediction will be minted as an NFT and costs 20 USDC to mint. You can mint as many brackets/predictions as you want. The bracket minting fees are collected into a rewards pool to be split among the Top 20 participants with the highest number of correctly predicted games. The rewards will be airdropped to you in USDC once the tournament ends. The 20 winners will share the prize pot as follows: </p> <ul> <li> 1st place: 15% of prize pool + 4,500 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 2nd place: 12% of prize pool + 3,600 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 3rd place: 10% of prize pool + 3,000 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 4th place: 8% of prize pool + 2,400 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 5th place: 7% of prize pool + 2,100 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 6th place: 6% of prize pool + 1,800 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 7th place: 5% of prize pool + 1,500 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 8th place: 4% of prize pool + 1,200 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 9th place: 4% of prize pool + 1,200 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> 10th place: 4% of prize pool + 1,200 $OVER Free Bet </li> <li> Places 11–15: 3% of prize pool + 900 $OVER Free Bet each </li> <li> Places 16–20: 2% of prize pool + 600 $OVER Free Bet each </li> </ul> <p> Your bracket points are calculated using the following principle: </p> <ul> <li> 1st Round games: 1 point per correct pick </li> <li> 2nd Round games: 2 points per correct pick </li> <li> Sweet 16 games: 4 points per correct pick </li> <li> Elite Eight games: 8 points per correct pick </li> <li> Final Four games: 16 points per correct pick </li> <li> Final Game: 32 points for the correct pick </li> </ul> <p>The maximum possible points for any bracket is 192 points. Additional rules: </p> <ul> <li> One wallet can mint as many brackets as it wants. </li> <li> The bracket ID will be used as a tiebreaker for brackets with equal points, where a lower number (i.e. earlier mint) bracket IDs will have an advantage. </li> <li> Identical brackets minted by the same wallet will be counted as one bracket. The earlier you mint, the better. </li> </ul> <p> And with these final details, you are all set!

This will give you the amount of reward per point. The formula incentivizes positions with lower odds and higher volume, so the bigger you go, the more rewards you’ll get. The best part? You <strong>don’t really need to calculate</strong> all of this yourself. <br> <br>You can follow your progress and see your rewards grow using Dune, all transparently and easily accessible. <strong>Track your rewards: </strong> </span> <a href='https://dune.com/leifu/overtime-big-leagues-campaign-23-24' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Dune dashboard</u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> </p> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 1: Low Odds with Low Volume </span> </span> </span> </h3> <span> <span> <span>Say you have a parlay with the following implied Odds (X): 0.2 (20% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $500. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.2/2) * 500 = <strong>450 points</strong>. </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 2: High Odds with High Volume </span> </span> </span> <br /> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In this case, your implied Odds are (X): 0.8 (80% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $5000. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.8/2) * 5000 = <strong>3000 points</strong>. </span> </span> </span> </p> <span> <span></span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span></span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 3 (Adding up your tickets total points) </span> </span> </span> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In example 3, we will demonstrate how parlay totals are added together. Your first parlay has implied Odds (X): 0.6 and the trading Volume (V) is $800. This gives you a total of: Pn = (1–0.6/2) * 800 = <strong>560 points</strong>. <br> <br>The other parlay has Odds of 0.4 with $1200 in volume, leading to (1–0.4/2) * 1200 = <strong>960 points</strong>. <br> <br> Add those up and you get 960+560 = <strong>1520 points.</strong> </span> </span> <span> <br> <br> Remember that parlays involving multiple incentivized leagues will be treated separately in each ranking. <br> <br> For example, a parlay ticket that includes games from the EPL, NBA, and NFL will be counted in each of the three leaderboards, somewhat acting as a 3x multiplier. If the ticket involves games from two leagues, it will be counted twice in the corresponding leaderboards </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>SportsAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> and </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>ParlayAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span>.</span> </span> </span> </p> <p> <hr><h2> <span> End-of-Season Reward Distribution </span> </h2> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Your hard-earned rewards will be distributed at the end of each respective season.
