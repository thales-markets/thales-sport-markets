            "contentHtml": "<p> <span> <span> <span>The start of the Overdrop League marks a new era in incentives on Overtime. Everything you do on the platform counts toward your total XP, your XP determines your rewards at the end of the season, and you can reach several levels/milestones to get THALES free bets throughout the year, along with other perks. In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP. The total rewards pool for this season is 100,000 OP and 200,000 ARB. <h2>How does the Overdrop League work?</h2>The Overdrop League lets you earn rewards and boost your earnings on Overtime by accumulating trading volume, maintaining usage streaks, using THALES as collateral, sharing your parlays on socials, building multi-game parlays, and collecting event- or sports-specific points modifiers! You can level up your way to 33,850 THALES and unlock many additional perks and bonuses along the way. Track your progress in the new Overdrop section of your profile in the navigation. <span> <span> <span> <span> <span></span> </span> </span> <span> <br> The base calculation for your XP is calculated like this: Base XP = Buy-In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). In simpler terms, your wager gets more base XP the higher your buy-in and odds are. <br> <br>Buy-In in this case means the amount of $ that you placed as a Buy-In on the respective wager. Normalized Odds mean the odds of your wager shown in the format of a Normalized Probability between 0 and 1. For example, the Decimal Odds expression of 1.60 is 0.625 in the Normalized Odds format. You can boost your XP gains in the following way: <br> <br> </span> <ul> <li> <span> <span> <span>Daily streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive day wagering on OT, up to 35%</span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>Weekly streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive week wagering on OT, up to 20%</span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>X Flex boost: An additional 10% XP for 3 days after sharing your parlay on X that can be reactivated after the booster expires</span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>Parlay boost: Up to 290% in additional XP based on how many games you add to your parlay </span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>THALES boost: 10% additional XP for using THALES as collateral for a specific wager/trade</span> </span> </span> </li> <li> <span> <span> <span>Loyalty boost: Up to 25% in permanent additional XP rewarded based on your level</span> </span> </span> </li> </ul> <span> <br>Throughout the season, you'll gradually unlock 33,850 THALES in free bets after hitting certain levels.

This will give you the amount of reward per point. The formula incentivizes positions with lower odds and higher volume, so the bigger you go, the more rewards you’ll get. The best part? You <strong>don’t really need to calculate</strong> all of this yourself. <br> <br>You can follow your progress and see your rewards grow using Dune, all transparently and easily accessible. <strong>Track your rewards: </strong> </span> <a href='https://dune.com/leifu/overtime-big-leagues-campaign-23-24' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Dune dashboard</u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> </p> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 1: Low Odds with Low Volume </span> </span> </span> </h3> <span> <span> <span>Say you have a parlay with the following implied Odds (X): 0.2 (20% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $500. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.2/2) * 500 = <strong>450 points</strong>. </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 2: High Odds with High Volume </span> </span> </span> <br /> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In this case, your implied Odds are (X): 0.8 (80% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $5000. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.8/2) * 5000 = <strong>3000 points</strong>. </span> </span> </span> </p> <span> <span></span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span></span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 3 (Adding up your tickets total points) </span> </span> </span> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In example 3, we will demonstrate how parlay totals are added together. Your first parlay has implied Odds (X): 0.6 and the trading Volume (V) is $800. This gives you a total of: Pn = (1–0.6/2) * 800 = <strong>560 points</strong>. <br> <br>The other parlay has Odds of 0.4 with $1200 in volume, leading to (1–0.4/2) * 1200 = <strong>960 points</strong>. <br> <br> Add those up and you get 960+560 = <strong>1520 points.</strong> </span> </span> <span> <br> <br> Remember that parlays involving multiple incentivized leagues will be treated separately in each ranking. <br> <br> For example, a parlay ticket that includes games from the EPL, NBA, and NFL will be counted in each of the three leaderboards, somewhat acting as a 3x multiplier. If the ticket involves games from two leagues, it will be counted twice in the corresponding leaderboards </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>SportsAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> and </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>ParlayAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span>.</span> </span> </span> </p> <p> <hr><h2> <span> End-of-Season Reward Distribution </span> </h2> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Your hard-earned rewards will be distributed at the end of each respective season.
