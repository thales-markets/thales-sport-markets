By doing so it helps users understand the risks of using those smart contracts and what the specific interactions entail. The frontend does not facilitate anything else apart from interacting with those contracts in a visually comprehensive way. In doing so, it is no different than the functionality provided by Etherscan or RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls). The frontend itself does not belong to Thales DAO or any individual.

Thales DAO uses the decentralised sUSD token as collateral for all its transactions.
